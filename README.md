# Scrape-Warm-Site
This Powershell script has the ability to retrieve and output all of a site's URIs by scraping its sitemap for links, followed by parsing HTML of those links, and gives an option to warm the site automatically or manually through generated curls.

## Features:
- Starting with a site's parent sitemap, scrape for child sitemaps and get all links
- Output sitemaps and links as list and curls in individual files
- Choice whether to scrape links for URIs found in <i>any tag-attribute combination</i> you want. E.g. <code>&lt;a href&gt;, &lt;img src&gt;, &lt;img srcset&gt;, &lt;img data-src&gt;, &lt;img data-srcset&gt;, &lt;link rel&gt;, &lt;script src&gt;</code>
- URIs are domain-specific (i.e. same domain as the sitemaps and links)
- Output each tag-attribute's URIs to files
- Output each tag-attribute's URIs as curls to files
- Choice whether to warm site with the above URIs as part of script

## Requirements:
- A sitemap formatted in the <a href="https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html" target="_blank">Sitemap protocol format</a>, populated with links
- <a href="https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell#get-powershell" target="_blank">Powershell v3</a>
- Windows / *nix environment

## Additional Information
- By default, script directory (where you run the script) needs <b>read, execute, write permissions</b>. All created files/folders will reside in the script directory.

## Background: 								
- Website owners may want to warm their site (i.e. "preload the cache") from a remote client especially so if they use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).
- Search Engine Optimization (SEO) typically involves optimizing a website's load times, and one of the most effective means of doing so is to preload or 'warm' the web cache. This script can be configured to do this automatically; alternatively site warming can be achieved through using the curls generated in separate files for portability.
- Website owners might want a list of links of all their resources (blog posts, media, etc.) if they intend to migrate their site (e.g. changing a domain name). This script can search for all of those and output them as a list.
- Website owners may simply need a list of their sitemaps, or links from those sitemaps.
